Emissions by Unit and Fuel Type (from the US Environmental Protection Agency) : https://www.epa.gov/system/files/other-files/2024-10/emissions_by_unit_and_fuel_type_c_d_aa.zip

THe zipped file contained an Excel binary file, with four sheets : Emissions by Unit type, Emissions by Fuel type, Industry type referencing to the first two sheets and a Q&A sheet. 
We chose to focus on only the first sheet, which contained CO2 emissions of energy producers. The third sheet containing information about the sub-sectors in which the energy facilities are listed. We saved these two sheets in two separate CSV files. 
We needed to unzip it and create a CSV manually because the native file contained lines not understandable by R.

Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) Data (from the US Census Bureau) :
https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/qwi/latest_release/al/qwi_al_se_fs_gs_n4_op_u.csv.gz

We manually unzipped the unique datafile before loading it into R.
